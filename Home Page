            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p1>
                My name is Jacob Schoff and I am an up and coming software engineer. I have spent countless hours studing both front and
                back-end languages in order to make myself as competent and qualified as possible. Through these endeavors I have compiled
                this website here for you to see some of what I have learned.

        <h2>Process thus far</h2>
            <p1>My first coding language was Python in which I created several projects ranging from temperature conversions to password generators
                and many more. This helped spark the drive which has led me to dive into the vast array of programming. Please click the resume link
                in the top menu for a more detailed list as my professional development if you would like to see some of the languages I work with
                as well as my professional background. Additionally, my github, LinkedIn, and Tableau have been provided as well for further project review.
